# Calculating page load time:

## 1. Devtools
One method to calculate page load time is to use devtools network option.
In the picture shown below I have marked the load time with red underline. 
This time shows the total period to download files and load.

## 2. Vanilla JS code

Using the following code the time required to display the root html page of react is calculated 

```
var before_loadtime = new Date().getTime();
window.onload = Pageloadtime;
export function Pageloadtime() {
  var aftr_loadtime = new Date().getTime();
  // Time calculating in seconds
  var pgloadtime = (aftr_loadtime - before_loadtime) / 1000;

  console.log(pgloadtime);
}

```
